## Context

In Bigger cities there is a tendency of house prices going up and because of this, there is a huge necessity of knowing the prices of houses deoending on aspects such as Neighbourhood, Distance to hubs, Age of house, etc. Boston as a big city have also this problem so there is a lot of data about houses and a crecent necessity for an accurate precision tool.

## Problem Statement

The problem on hand is to predict the housing prices of a town or a suburb based on the features of the locality provided to us. In the process, we need to identify the most important features in the dataset. We need to employ techniques of data preprocessing and build a linear regression model that predicts the prices for us.

## Code

The program was written on Jupyter Notebooks in Python Language. You can access to the code [here](https://github.com/CharlesDeLabra/Boston-House-Price-Prediction/blob/main/Learners_Notebook_Boston_house_price.ipynb)

## Status

The code is finished and have been evaluated, the goal was completed since it were develpo different model in order to predict prices of Boston Houses and they were good enough to trust their predictions
